## How to contribute to rgbCTF

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in rgbCTF**. Instead [email the details to us at rgbsec@rgbsec.xyz](mailto:rgbsec@rgbsec.xyz).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/RGBsec/rgbctf-backend/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/RGBsec/rgbctf-backend/issues/new). Be sure to fill out the issue template with a **title and clear description**, and as much relevant information as possible (e.g. deployment setup, browser version, etc).

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or implements a new feature?**

* Open a new pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Ensure all status checks pass. PR's with test failures will not be merged. PR's with insufficient coverage may be merged depending on the situation.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of rgbCTF will generally not be accepted.
